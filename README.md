# How to use Fresh Tomatoes

The file called `fresh_tomatoes.py` takes in arguments which it receives from the file called `enertainment_centre.py`and passes it through `media.py` file.

## to view fresh_tomatoes.html
Simply open the `fresh_tomatoes.html` file in any browser, you will be presented with a web page which will display six of my current favourite movies.
The information presnted consists of the poster image, the title of the movie, the rating of the movie and a short detailed synopsys of the movie.

## How to view the trailer
The trailer for each movie can be easily viewed.To do this simply `click` on the *poster image* of the movie you wish to view.
A seperate movie trailer screen will then appear. You can adjust the `volume`, and `quality` of the trailer.
Should you wish to exit, simply press the close **`X`** in the top left hand courner of the movie trailer screen.

## Can I  make changes to the movies?
This is possible, by making changes to the `entertainment_center.py` file.
This file contains all the individual information about each movie which is displayed in the `fresh_tomatoes.html` file.
Changes can be made like the _**rating**_, _**synopsys**_, _**movie trailer**_, and the _**poster image**_.
The file called `media.py` should not be changed as this is the `parent` file.
